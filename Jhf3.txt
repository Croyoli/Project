screwed up the initial Project creation, needed to make a Main branch first
before anyone did a git checkout because that branch created using the
git checkout became the default branch and thus could not pull request since
it was already default branch.  suggest changing the 3.2 instructions to 
making a new Main branch before anyone does a git checkout.  either that
or i did something wrong.
